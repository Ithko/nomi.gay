### Basic info:

- Height: If I was a ballistic missile traveling at mach 10 facing straight my head would hit you ~550µs earlier than my feet.
- Gender: I already told you that I am a woman-ish creature, what else do you need to know?

- Fav. weather: Cloudy, chilly (~10°C) day.

I do most of my actual coding in Rust and C, scripting in python and bash, but I know other programming languages too. Rust is a [{{ icon(icon="video-box") }}great language](https://youtu.be/MZdxbf0_fPg) btw, especially when it comes to error handling.
